# EcoreMetamodelExtraction
A prototype that tries to extract Ecore metamodels from Java code.

IMPORTANT:
The EcoreMetamodelExtraction prototype currently saves in a fixed path in the runtime workspace.
That means that one needs an empty EMF project in the runtime workspace called "EME-Generator-Output".
The generated .ecore files are saved in the folder "model" and can be seen in the Eclipse IDE after manually refreshing the folder.
